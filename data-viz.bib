  abstract = {Web-based data visualizations have become very popular for exploring data and communicating insights. Newspapers, journals, and  reports regularly publish visualizations to tell compelling stories with data. Unfortunately, most visualizations are inaccessible to  readers with visual impairments. For many charts on the web, there are no accompanying alternative (alt) texts, and even if such texts exist they do not adequately describe important insights from charts. To address the problem, we first interviewed 15 blind users  to understand their challenges and requirements for reading data visualizations. Based on the insights from these interviews, we  developed SeeChart, an interactive tool that automatically deconstructs charts from web pages and then converts them to accessible  visualizations for blind people by enabling them to hear the chart summary as well as to interact through data points using the  keyboard. Our evaluation with 14 blind participants suggests the efficacy of SeeChart in understanding key insights from charts and  fulfilling their information needs while reducing their required time and cognitive burden.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A remote user test was performed with two versions (one accessible and one non-accessible) of three types of web-based charts (horizontal bar chart, vertical stacked bar chart, and line chart). The objectives of the test were: (a) to validate a set of heuristic indicators for the evaluation of the accessibility of statistical charts presented in a previous work (Fariñas Falcón et al. in Mediocentro Electrónica 21(1):65–68, 2017); (b) to identify new barriers and preferences for users with low vision in the access and use of this content not previously contemplated. 12 users were tested, with a variety of conditions associated with low vision: low visual acuity (6 users), reduced central vision (2 users), reduced peripheral vision (2 users), blurry vision (1 user), sensitivity to light (3 users), Nystagmus (2 users) and color vision deficiency (CVD) (4 users). From a quantitative standpoint, accessible versions of charts were more efficient, effective, and satisfactory. From a qualitative point of view, results verify the relevance of heuristics H2, Legend; H3, Axes; H6, Data source (as data table); H10, Safe colors; H11, Contrast; H12, Legibility; H13, Image quality; H14, Resize; H16, Focus visible; H17, Independent navigation; related to the proposed tasks. As new observations, tooltips were highly valued by all users, but their implementation must be improved to avoid covering up significant parts of the charts when displayed. The data table has also been frequently used by all users, especially in the non-accessible versions, allowing them to carry out tasks more efficiently. The position and size of the legend can be a significant barrier if it is too small or appears in an unusual position. Finally, despite the limitations related to color perception, some users prefer color graphics to black and white, so, to target all profiles, it is necessary to redundantly encode categories with colors and patterns as well.},

Besides providing temporal image stability, they amortize the rendering costs over multiple frames and thus improve the minimum frame rate. We present a method that adopts this idea to accelerate 2D information visualization, without requiring any changes to the rendering itself. By exploiting properties of orthographic projection, our method significantly improves rendering performance while minimizing the loss of image quality during camera manipulation. For static scenes, it quickly converges to the full-resolution image. We discuss the characteristics and different modes of our method concerning rendering performance and image quality and the corresponding trade-offs. To improve ease of use, we provide automatic resolution scaling in our method to adapt to user-defined target frame rate. Finally, we present extensive rendering benchmarks to examine real-world performance for examples of parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrix visualizations, and discuss appropriate application scenarios and contraindications for usage.

  abstract = {We survey the state of the art of spatial interfaces for 3D visualization. Interaction techniques are crucial to data visualization processes and the visualization research community has been calling for more research on interaction for years. Yet, research papers focusing on interaction techniques, in particular for 3D visualization purposes, are not always published in visualization venues, sometimes making it challenging to synthesize the latest interaction and visualization results. We therefore introduce a taxonomy of interaction technique for 3D visualization. The taxonomy is organized along two axes: the primary source of input on the one hand and the visualization task they support on the other hand. Surveying the state of the art allows us to highlight specific challenges and missed opportunities for research in 3D visualization. In particular, we call for additional research in: (1) controlling 3D visualization widgets to help scientists better understand their data, (2) 3D interaction techniques for dissemination, which are under-explored yet show great promise for helping museum and science centers in their mission to share recent knowledge, and (3) developing new measures that move beyond traditional time and errors metrics for evaluating visualizations that include spatial interaction.},

We consider two types of 3D visualization datasets and provide different data encoding methods for haptic representations. Two user experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The first experimental results show that adding a mid-air haptic modality can be beneficial regardless of noise conditions and useful for handling occlusion or discerning density and volume information. The second experiment results further show the strengths and weaknesses of direct touch and indirect touch modes. Our findings can shed light on designing and implementing a tangible interaction on 3D data visualization with mid-air haptic feedback.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Existing work on visualizing multivariate graphs is primarily concerned with representing the attributes of nodes. Even though edges are the constitutive elements of networks, there have been only few attempts to visualize attributes of edges. In this work, we focus on the critical importance of edge attributes for interpreting network visualizations and building trust in the underlying data. We propose ‘unfolding of edges’ as an interactive approach to integrate multivariate edge attributes dynamically into existing node‐link diagrams. Unfolding edges is an in‐situ approach that gradually transforms basic links into detailed representations of the associated edge attributes. This approach extends focus+context, semantic zoom, and animated transitions for network visualizations to accommodate edge details on‐demand without cluttering the overall graph layout. We explore the design space for the unfolding of edges, which covers aspects of making space for the unfolding, of actually representing the edge context, and of navigating between edges. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present two case studies in the context of historical network analysis and computational social science. For these, web‐based prototypes were implemented based on which we conducted interviews with domain experts. The experts' feedback suggests that the proposed unfolding of edges is a useful tool for exploring rich edge information of multivariate graphs.},

  abstract = {In written and spoken communications, metaphors are often used as an aid to help convey abstract or less tangible concepts. However, the benefits of using visual metaphors in visualization have so far been inconclusive. In this work, we report an empirical study to evaluate hypotheses that visual metaphors may aid memorization, visual search and concept comprehension. One major departure from previous metaphor-related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual-task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (e.g., in meetings and classes). The use of the secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual metaphors more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials. The results of this study show that visual metaphors can help participants better remember the information depicted in visualization. On the other hand, visual metaphors can have a negative impact on the speed of visual search. The results also show a complex pattern as to the benefits of visual metaphors in helping participants grasp key concepts from visualization.},

  abstract = {Force-directed (FD) algorithms can be used to explore relationships in social networks, visualize money markets, and analyze transaction networks. However, FD algorithms are mainly designed for visualizing static graphs in which the topology of the networks remains constant throughout the calculation. In contrast to static graphs, nodes and edges in dynamic graphs can be added or removed as time progresses. In these situations, existing FD algorithms do not scale well, since any changes in the topology will trigger these algorithms to completely restart the entire computation. To alleviate this problem, we propose a design and implementation of five online FD algorithms to visualize dynamic graphs while maintaining their native force models. The online FD algorithms developed in this paper are able to reuse the force models of existing FD algorithms without significant modifications. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, online FD algorithms are compared against static FD algorithms for visualizing dynamic graphs. Experimental results show that among the five algorithms evaluated, the online FD algorithm achieves the best number of edge crossings and the standard deviation of edge lengths for visualizing dynamic graphs.},

  abstract = {Data visualizations are ubiquitous in all disciplines and have become the primary means of analysing data and communicating insights. However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of recommender systems, providing suggestions in numerous applications with potentially high social impact, such as health or justice. Meanwhile, in Europe, the upcoming AI Act mentions \textbackslash emph\{transparency\} as a requirement for critical AI systems in order to ``mitigate the risks to fundamental rights''. Post-hoc explanations seamlessly align with this goal and extensive literature on the subject produced several forms of such objects, graphs being one of them. Early studies in visualization demonstrated the graphs' ability to improve user understanding, positioning them as potentially ideal explanations. However, it remains unclear how graph-based explanations compare to other explanation designs. In this work, we aim to determine the effectiveness of graph-based explanations in improving users' perception of AI-based recommendations using a mixed-methods approach. We first conduct a qualitative study to collect users' requirements for graph explanations. We then run a larger quantitative study in which we evaluate the influence of various explanation designs, including enhanced graph-based ones, on aspects such as understanding, usability and curiosity toward the AI system. We find that users perceive graph-based explanations as more usable than designs involving feature importance. However, we also reveal that textual explanations lead to higher objective understanding than graph-based designs. Most importantly, we highlight the strong contrast between participants' expressed preferences for graph design and their actual ratings using it, which are lower compared to textual design. These findings imply that meeting stakeholders' expressed preferences might not alone guarantee ``good'' explanations. Therefore, crafting hybrid designs successfully balancing social expectations with downstream performance emerges as a significant challenge.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Accessibility of data visualization has been explored for users with visual disabilities but the needs of users with language disabilities have seldom been considered.                                         Aim               This scoping review synthesised what is known about data visualization for adults with language disabilities, specifically the acquired language disability, aphasia and Developmental Language Disorder. It sought to extract key findings and identify what practices support effective visualization for decision making for people with language disabilities.                                         Method               Papers were included if they investigated visualization of data, and the consumers of the data visualization were people with aphasia or developmental language disability. Seven databases were searched: CINAHL, Academic Search, Medline, PsychINFO, Ovid, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore. Included studies were charted to extract title, author(s), year, country, paper type, scientific field, participant number(s), participant group(s), main topic, subtopic, method, task description, task category, data visualization, summary, key findings relevant to the review question, and guidelines or recommendations. Narrative synthesis was used to describe how people with language disability have interacted with data visualization from a range of literature.                                         Main Contribution                                Six studies (seven publications) were included in the review. One study came from the field of health, one from a disability rights collaboration and four studies from computer science. No studies satisfying the review criteria explored data visualization for Developmental Language Disorder; however, five studies explored participants with cognitive disabilities that included impairments of language, so these were included. A range of visualization designs were found. Studies predominantly explored                 understanding                 of visualization (4/6). One study explored how to                 express                 data visually, and one explored the                 use                 of the visualization that is, for an action, choice, or decision. Cognitively accessible data visualization practices were described in four papers and synthesized. Supportive practices reported were reducing the cognitive load associated with processing a visualization and increasing personal relevance of data visualization.                                                        Conclusion               Accessible data visualization for adults with aphasia and Developmental Language Disorder has only minimally been explored. Practices to specifically support users with language disability are not yet apparent. As data use in making everyday decisions is widespread, future research should explore how people with language disabilities make use of data visualization.                                         WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS                                What is already known on this subject                                                                                Visual resources are used widely to support people with language disabilities in understanding of language. That is, icons, maps timelines and so forth, are used to support auditory processing. However, data visualization is used routinely by people without a language disability to support everyday decisions for example, visualization of live traffic data is used to provide users with the best route to their destination. It is unclear whether any work has explored data visualization for people with language disabilities.~                                                                                                        What this paper adds to existing knowledge                                                                                This paper brings together research on the use of data visualization by adults with either Developmental Language Disorder or aphasia, collectively people with language disabilities. It highlights a gap in the design of inclusive data visualization for language disabilities and the minimal research exploring the use of data visualization for decision making in these populations.                                                                                                        What are the clinical implications of this work?                                                                                Access to data can be empowering. It has potential to enable agency in decisions and increase social participation. The existing gap in knowledge about how to design inclusive data visualization for people with language disabilities thus poses a risk of exclusion and threats to informed decision making. Highlighting the current field of literature may drive research and clinical activity.},

  abstract = {A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.” Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed},

Observational studies are an alternative, but can easily lead to doubtful results, because of unbalanced selection bias and confounding. Moreover, RCTs often only apply to a specific subgroup and cannot readily be extrapolated. In response, we present Rod of Asclepius (RoA), a novel visual analytics method that integrates modern techniques designed for identification of causal effects and effect size estimation with subgroup analysis. The result is an interactive display designed to combine exploratory analysis with a robust set of techniques, including causal do-calculus, propensity score weighting, and effect estimation. It enables analysts to conduct observational studies in an exploratory, yet robust way. This is demonstrated by means of a use case involving patients undergoing surgery, for which we collaborated closely with clinical researchers.},

  abstract = {Data visualization has become an increasingly important means of effective data communication and has played a vital role in broadcasting the progression of COVID-19. Accessible data representations, however, have lagged behind, leaving areas of information out of reach for many blind and visually impaired (BVI) users. In this work, we sought to understand (1) the accessibility of current implementations of visualizations on the web; (2) BVI users’ preferences and current experiences when accessing data-driven media; (3) how accessible data representations on the web address these users’ access needs and help them navigate, interpret, and gain insights from the data; and (4) the practical challenges that limit BVI users’ access and use of data representations. To answer these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of an accessibility audit of 87 data visualizations on the web to identify accessibility issues, an online survey of 127 screen reader users to understand lived experiences and preferences, and a remote contextual inquiry with 12 of the survey respondents to observe how they navigate, interpret, and gain insights from accessible data representations. Our observations during this critical period of time provide an understanding of the widespread accessibility issues encountered across online data visualizations, the impact that data accessibility inequities have on the BVI community, the ways screen reader users sought access to data-driven information and made use of online visualizations to form insights, and the pressing need to make larger strides towards improving data literacy, building confidence, and enriching methods of access. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners to broaden data accessibility on the web.},

  abstract = {Dynamic networks reflect temporal changes occurring to the graph's structure and are used to model a wide variety of problems in many application fields. We investigate the design space of dynamic graph visualization along two major dimensions: the network structural and temporal representation. Significant research has been conducted evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of different structural representations for static graphs, however, few extend this comparison to a dynamic network setting. We conduct a study where we assess the participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of the graph's structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without support of common interaction methods. Our results suggest that matrices provide better support for tasks on lower-level entities and basic interactions require longer response times while increasing accuracy. Node-link with auto animation proved to be the quickest and most accurate combination overall, while animation with playback control the most preferred temporal encoding.},

The article begins with a reader-centered design philosophy that distills the maxim “know thy user” into three components: (a) know your users′ tasks, (b) know the operations supported by your displays, and (c) match user's operations to the ones supported by your display. Next, factors affecting the decision to present data in text, tables, or graphs are described: the amount of data, the readers′ informational needs, and the value of visualizing the data. The remainder of the article outlines the design decisions required once an author has selected graphs as the data presentation medium. Decisions about the type of graph depend on the readers′ experience and informational needs as well as characteristics of the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (criterion) variable. Finally, specific guidelines for the design of graphs are presented. The guidelines were derived from empirical studies, analyses of graph readers′ tasks, and practice-based design guidelines. The guidelines focus on matching the specific sensory, perceptual, and cognitive operations required to read a graph to the operations that the graph supports.},

  abstract = {Creating graph visualizations involves many decisions, such as layout, node and edge appearance, and color choices. These decisions are challenging due to the multitude of options available. For instance, graph layout can be force-directed or orthogonal, and edges can be curved, tapered, partially drawn, or animated. Thus, research offers a multitude of guidelines to optimize graph visualizations for human perception and usability. Guidelines can be actionable, providing direct instructions, or non-actionable, specifying what to avoid. This work focuses on actionable guidelines for node-link diagrams, aiding designers in making better decisions.  Given the abundance of graph visualization research and the difficulty in navigating it, this work aims to collect and structure actionable guidelines for node-linkvisualizations. To demonstrate the general applicability of our approach to structuring actionable guidelines for node-link diagrams, we also included guidelines for visualizing graphs as matrices. It also proposes a visual interactive system, GuidelineExplorer, to apply guidelines directly to graphs, streamlining the design process and promoting collaboration within the research community.},

However, the sole dependency on vision can produce unintended discrimination against people with visual impairments. While the visualization field has seen enormous growth in recent years, supporting people with disabilities is much less explored. In this work, we examine approaches to support this marginalized user group, focusing on visual disabilities. We collected and analyzed papers published for the last 20 years on visualization accessibility. We mapped a design space for accessible visualization that includes seven dimensions: user group, literacy task, chart type, interaction, information granularity, sensory modality, assistive technology. We described the current knowledge gap in light of the latest advances in visualization and presented a preliminary accessibility model by synthesizing findings from existing research. Finally, we reflected on the dimensions and discussed opportunities and challenges for future research.},

  abstract = {This article shows that animated display of time-varying data (e.g., stock or commodity prices) enhances risk judgments. We outline a process whereby animated display enhances the visual salience of transitions in a trajectory (i.e., successive changes in data values), which leads to transitions being utilized more to form cognitive inferences about risk. In turn, this leads to inflated risk judgments. The studies reported in this article provide converging evidence via eye tracking (Study 1), serial mediation analyses (Studies 2 and 3), and experimental manipulations of transition salience (graph type; Study 3) and utilization of transitions (global trend; Study 4 and investment goals; Study 5) and, in the process, outline boundary conditions. The studies also demonstrate the effect of animated display on consequential investment decisions and behavior. This article adds to the literature on salience effects by disambiguating the role of inference making in how salience of stimuli causes biases in judgments. Broader implications for visual information processing, data visualization, financial decision making, and public policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Improvements in the quantification and visual analysis of data, plotted across non-standardized graphs, are possible with the equations introduced in this paper. Equation 1 (an expression of graphic scale variability) forms part of the foundation for Equation 2 (an expansion on the traditional calculation of the tangent inverse of a line’s algebraic slope). These equations provide clarification regarding aspects of “slope” and graphic scaling that have previously confused mathematicians. The apparent lack of correspondence between geometric slope (the angle of inclination) and algebraic slope (the m in y = mx + b) on “non-homogeneous” graphs (graphs where the scale values/distances on the y-axis are not the same as on the x-axis) is identified and directly resolved. This is important because nearly all behavior analytic graphs are “non-homogeneous” and problems with consistent visual inspection of such graphs have yet to be fully resolved. This paper shows how the precise geometric slope for any trend line on any non-homogeneous graph can quickly be determined—potentially improving the quantification and visual analysis of treatment effects in terms of the amount/magnitude of change in slope/variability. The equations herein may also be used to mathematically control for variability inherent in a graph’s idiosyncratic construction, and thus facilitate valid comparison of data plotted on various non-standard graphs constructed with very different axes scales—both within and across single case design research studies. The implications for future research and the potential for improving effect size measures and meta-analyses in single-subject research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The visualization community has a rich history of reflecting upon visualization design flaws. Although research in this area has remained lively, we believe it is essential to continuously revisit this classic and critical topic in visualization research by incorporating more empirical evidence from diverse sources, characterizing new design flaws, building more systematic theoretical frameworks, and understanding the underlying reasons for these flaws. To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur. Specifically, we analyzed 2227 flawed data visualizations collected from an online gallery and derived a design task-associated taxonomy containing 76 specific design flaws. These flaws were further classified into three high-level categories (i.e., misinformation, uninformativeness, unsociability) and ten subcategories (e.g., inaccuracy, unfairness, ambiguity). Next, we organized five focus groups to explore why these design flaws occur and identified seven causes of the flaws. Finally, we proposed a research agenda for combating visualization design flaws and summarize nine research opportunities.},

However, what we see is not necessarily what we think about. In many cases, end‐users do not take care of scaling the projection space with respect to the multidimensional space. Anyway, when using non‐linear mappings, scaling is not even possible. Yet, without scaling geometrical structures which might appear do not make more sense than considering a random map. Without scaling, we shall not make inference from the display back to the multidimensional space. No clusters, no trends, no outliers, there is nothing to infer without first quantifying the mapping quality. Several methods to qualify mappings have been devised. Here, we propose CheckViz, a new method belonging to the framework of Verity Visualization. We define a two‐dimensional perceptually uniform colour coding which allows visualizing tears and false neighbourhoods, the two elementary and complementary types of geometrical mapping distortions, straight onto the map at the location where they occur. As examples shall demonstrate, this visualization method is essential to help users make sense out of the mappings and to prevent them from over interpretations. It could be applied to check other mappings as well.},

Compared to existing work on LLM‐based visualization works that generate and control visualization with textual input and output only, the proposed approach explores the utilization of the visual processing ability of multi‐modal LLMs to develop Autonomous Visualization Agents (AVAs) that can evaluate the generated visualization and iterate on the result to accomplish user‐defined objectives defined through natural language. We propose the first framework for the design of AVAs and present several usage scenarios intended to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed paradigm. Our preliminary exploration and proof‐of‐concept agents suggest that this approach can be widely applicable whenever the choices of appropriate visualization parameters require the interpretation of previous visual output. Our study indicates that AVAs represent a general paradigm for designing intelligent visualization systems that can achieve high‐level visualization goals, which pave the way for developing expert‐level visualization agents in the future.},

  abstract = {Visualizations are widely used in the communication of climate projections. However, their effectiveness has rarely been assessed among their target audience. Given recent calls to increase the usability of climate information through the tailoring of climate projections, it is imperative to assess the effectiveness of different visualizations. This paper explores the complexities of tailoring through an online survey conducted with 162 local adaptation practitioners in Germany and the UK. The survey examined respondents’ assessed and perceived comprehension (PC) of visual representations of climate projections as well as preferences for using different visualizations in communicating and planning for a changing climate. Comprehension and use are tested using four different graph formats, which are split into two pairs. Within each pair the information content is the same but is visualized differently. We show that even within a fairly homogeneous user group, such as local adaptation practitioners, there are clear differences in respondents’ comprehension of and preference for visualizations. We do not find a consistent association between assessed comprehension and PC or use within the two pairs of visualizations that we analysed. There is, however, a clear link between PC and use of graph format. This suggests that respondents use what they think they understand the best, rather than what they actually understand the best. These findings highlight that audience-specific targeted communication may be more complex and challenging than previously recognized.},

While other methods separate the creation of colors from their assignment, our approach takes data characteristics into account to produce color palettes, which are then assigned in a way that fosters better visual discrimination of classes. To do so, we use a customized optimization based on simulated annealing to maximize the combination of three carefully designed color scoring functions: point distinctness, name difference, and color discrimination. We compare our approach to state-ofthe-art palettes with a controlled user study for scatterplots and line charts, furthermore we performed a case study. Our results show that Palettailor, as a fully-automated approach, generates color palettes with a higher discrimination quality than existing approaches. The efficiency of our optimization allows us also to incorporate user modifications into the color selection process.},

  abstract = {Objective               To test optimal graphic risk communication formats for presenting small probabilities using graphics with a denominator of 1000 to adults with lower education and literacy.                                         Methods               A randomized experimental study, which took place in adult basic education classes in Sydney, Australia. The participants were 120 adults with lower education and literacy. An experimental computer-based manipulation compared 1) pictographs in 2 forms, shaded “blocks” and unshaded “dots”; and 2) bar charts across different orientations (horizontal/vertical) and numerator size (small {$<$}100, medium 100–499, large 500–999). Accuracy (size of error) and ease of processing (reaction time) were assessed on a gist task (estimating the larger chance of survival) and a verbatim task (estimating the size of difference). Preferences for different graph types were also assessed.                                         Results               Accuracy on the gist task was very high across all conditions ({$>$}95\%) and not tested further. For the verbatim task, optimal graph type depended on the numerator size. For small numerators, pictographs resulted in fewer errors than bar charts (blocks: odds ratio [OR] = 0.047, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.023–0.098; dots: OR = 0.049, 95\% CI = 0.024–0.099). For medium and large numerators, bar charts were more accurate (e.g., medium dots: OR = 4.29, 95\% CI = 2.9–6.35). Pictographs were generally processed faster for small numerators (e.g., blocks: 14.9 seconds v. bars: 16.2 seconds) and bar charts for medium or large numerators (e.g., large blocks: 41.6 seconds v. 26.7 seconds). Vertical formats were processed slightly faster than horizontal graphs with no difference in accuracy. Most participants preferred bar charts (64\%); however, there was no relationship with performance.                                         Conclusions               For adults with low education and literacy, pictographs are likely to be the best format to use when displaying small numerators ({$<$}100/1000) and bar charts for larger numerators ({$>$}100/1000).},

  abstract = {Charts play a vital role in data visualization, understanding data patterns, and informed decision-making. However, their unique combination of graphical elements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends) poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-language models trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle with generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model for universal chart comprehension and reasoning. ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT, a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic (e.g. bars and pies) and specialized (e.g. radars, and bubbles) chart types. It undergoes a two-stage training process, starting with pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followed by multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enables ChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart tasks. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art UniChart and Chartllama method, especially outperforming them on real-world chart data with zero-shot setting. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ChartAst.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Untargeted metabolomics promises comprehensive characterization of small molecules in biological samples. However, the field is hampered by low annotation rates and abstract spectral data. Despite recent advances in computational metabolomics, manual annotations and manual confirmation of in-silico annotations remain important in the field. Here, exploratory data analysis methods for mass spectral data provide overviews, prioritization, and structural hypothesis starting points to researchers facing large quantities of spectral data. In this research, we propose a fluid means of dealing with mass spectral data using specXplore, an interactive python dashboard providing interactive and complementary visualizations facilitating mass spectral similarity matrix exploration. Specifically, specXplore provides a two dimensional t-SNE embedding as a jumping board for local connectivity exploration using complementary interactive visualizations in the form of partial network drawings, similarity heatmaps, and fragmentation overview maps. SpecXplore makes use of of state of the art ms2deepscore pairwise spectral similarities as a quantitative backbone, while allowing fast changes of threshold and connectivity limitation settings, providing flexibility in adjusting settings to suit the localized node environment being explored. We believe that specXplore can become an integral part in mass spectral data exploration efforts and assist users in the generation of structural hypotheses for compounds of interest.                        Technical Terms                                             A network is a collection of connected features. In our case, a network consists of MS/MS spectral features connected provided their spectral similarity is high. Networks are represented using node-link-diagrams.                                               Node-link diagram -a term commonly used to refer to the graphical representation of a network via nodes and links (i.e. edges). In this paper, we use node-link diagram and network-view interchangeably.                                               A node is a feature in a network that can be connected to other features via edges. An alternative term for node is vertex.                                               An edge is a connection between two nodes. Other terms for edges are links or vertices.                                               Network layout refers to the spatial arrangement of nodes and edges on an usually two dimensional plotting surface. Network layout is also sometimes referred to as embedding. This term is avoided in this paper to avoid confusion with embedding in the machine learning sense.                                                                  Given a network                   G                   (                   V, E                   ), where                   V                   denotes its nodes and                   E                   its (weighted) edges, we define its topology as the relationships between individual (groups of) nodes and edges or the network as a whole, irrespective of the network’s layout.                                                                Molecular Networking (MN) is an exploratory data analysis technique merging spectral similarity-based topological clustering and visualization as node-link diagrams.                                               The plain English words group/grouping are wherever appropriate to avoid jargon terms such as clustering (as in k-medoid or k-means clustering), embedding (as in projection of groups of features into a close-by lower dimensional space), or molecular families. The latter are groups of spectral data features clustered and visualized as network-views via traditional MN or feature based molecular networking (FBMN). Molecular families, usually represent smaller, disconnected networks that are part of a larger dataset. When we refer to this disconnected nature, we use the phrasing disjoint sub-network for emphasis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Color is one of the most effective visual variables and is frequently used to encode metric quantities. Contrast effects are considered harmful in data visualizations since they significantly bias our perception of colors. For instance, a gray patch appears brighter on a black background than on a white background. Accordingly, the perception of color‐encoded data items depends on the surround in the rendered visualization. A method that compensates for contrast effects has been presented previously, which significantly improves the users’ accuracy in reading and comparing color encoded data. The method utilizes established perception models to compensate for contrast effects, assuming an average human observer. In this paper, we provide experiments that show a significant difference in the perception of users. We introduce methods to personalize contrast effect compensation and show that this outperforms the original method with a user study. We, further, overcome the major limitation of the original method, which is a runtime of several minutes. With the use of efficient optimization and surrogate models, we are able to reduce runtime to milliseconds, making the method applicable in interactive visualizations.},

  abstract = {People's associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered "non-colorable" (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Haptic devices are becoming more widely used as hardware becomes available and the cost of both low and high fidelity haptic devices decreases. One of the application areas of haptics is Haptic Data Visualization (HDV). HDV provides functionality by which users can feel and touch data. Blind and partially sighted users can benefit from HDV, as it helps them manipulate and understand information. However, developing any three-dimensional haptic world is difficult, time-consuming and requires skilled programmers. Therefore, systems that enable haptic worlds to be rapidly developed in a simple environment could enable non-computer skilled users to create haptic 3D interactions. In this article we present HITPROTO: a system that enables users, such as mentors or support workers, to quickly create haptic interactions (with an emphasis on HDVs) through a visual programming interface. We describe HITPROTO and include details of the design and implementation. We present the results of a detailed study using postgraduate students as potential mentors, which provides evidence of the usability of HITPROTO. We also present a pilot study of HITPROTO with a blind user. It can be difficult to create prototyping tools and support 3D interactions, therefore we present a detailed list of ‘lessons learnt’ that provides a set of guidelines for developers of other 3D haptic prototyping tools.},

This review focuses on haptic methods that display data. The hypothesis is that haptic devices can be used to present information, and consequently, the user gains quantitative, qualitative, or holistic knowledge about the presented data. Not only is this useful for users who are blind or partially sighted (who can feel line graphs, for instance), but also the haptic modality can be used alongside other modalities, to increase the amount of variables being presented, or to duplicate some variables to reinforce the presentation. Over the last 20 years, a significant amount of research has been done in haptic data presentation; e.g., researchers have developed force feedback line graphs, bar charts, and other forms of haptic representations. However, previous research is published in different conferences and journals, with different application emphases. This paper gathers and collates these various designs to provide a comprehensive review of designs for haptic data visualization. The designs are classified by their representation: Charts, Maps, Signs, Networks, Diagrams, Images, and Tables. This review provides a comprehensive reference for researchers and learners, and highlights areas for further research.},

In the current study, eye movement behavior was studied in seventy-six Chilean high school students, who read a set of twelve causally-related economics texts in Spanish in four experimental conditions. The objective is twofold. We aimed, on the one hand, to observe the main effects of the causal discourse marker (DM)~por tanto and the statistical causal graph (G), as well as the interaction effect of both variables on different eye tracking measures.~On the other,~we seek to observe the effects of the DM on the same eye tracking measures for the graph system (GS) area of interest (AOI).~The findings showed that the conjoint presence of the DM and the G did not positively influence the processing of selected AOIs. Analyses also reveal no significant effects on the GS AOI. Thus, the results indicate that the DM tend to decrease processing times, while the G increases them. Additional analyses conducted on the integrative transitions between the verbal system and the graph system reveal that more transitions were identified between the consequence segment and the graph system, thereby confirming that the consequence segment is crucial for the integration of both semiotic systems.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 data visualization practitioners, investigating how they understand chartjunk and the factors that influence how and when they make use of embellishments. Our investigation uncovers a broad and pluralistic understanding of chartjunk among practitioners, and foregrounds a variety of personal and situated factors that influence the use of chartjunk beyond context. We highlight the personal nature of design practice, and discuss the need for more practice-led research to better understand the ways in which concepts like chartjunk are interpreted and used by practitioners.},

Datasets which describe such multi-entity relationships are often modeled as hypergraphs, that can be difficult to visualize, especially when these relationships evolve over time. HyperStorylines builds upon Storylines, enabling the aggregation and nesting of these dynamic, multi-entity relationships. We report on the design process of HyperStorylines, which was informed by discussions and workshops with data journalists; and on the results of a comparative study in which participants had to answer questions inspired by the tasks that journalists typically perform with such data. We observe that although HyperStorylines takes some practice to master, it performs better for identifying and characterizing relationships than the selected baseline visualization (PAOHVis) and was preferred overall.},

  abstract = {How do virtual teams reach consensus when there is disagreement among team members and the consequences of making the wrong decision are high? To answer this question, the authors examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team responsible for air quality forecasting for the 5-million-person Atlanta region in the United States. They show that team members increase their use of visual representation technologies (VRTs), such as weather maps, during chat room discussions when the initial team consensus is low and the team is deciding whether to issue a smog alert that has large economic and health consequences. More use of VRTs in team discussions is associated with bigger shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater likelihood that the team changes its forecast to issue a smog alert. Greater use of VRTs is not associated with greater forecast accuracy. Increased VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion. For managers these results show that, in virtual team settings, some information technologies are associated with more persuasion than others and that training teams on the advantages and disadvantages of persuasive technologies is important.           ,              Although Fogg’s ideas of persuasive technologies are widely accepted, few attempts have been made to test his ideas, particularly in a team context. In this article, we (1) theoretically extend Fogg’s ideas by identifying contexts in which virtual teams are more likely to use persuasive technologies; (2) empirically measure technology visualness, a factor that likely makes technologies more or less persuasive; and (3) assess the association between the use of persuasive technologies, judgment shifts, and forecast performance in a real-world virtual team context. We identify visual representation technologies (VRTs) as a class of technologies used by virtual teams to select, transform, and present data in a rich visual format. We propose that such technologies play a persuasive, as well as diagnostic, role in virtual team decisions. Over a three-year period, we examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team that makes smog forecasts with large economic and health consequences. We supplement regression models of field data with an experiment, interviews with team members, and analyses of imagery processing and group cohesion in team language use. Experiment results show that, relative to non-VRTs, the use of a VRT in a forecasting task increases imagery processing. Field data results show that team members increase their use of VRTs during chat room discussions when initial team consensus is low and the environment is more exacting. Greater use of VRTs in team discussions relates to greater shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater odds of the team shifting its forecast policy to issue a smog alert. Increased use of VRTs is associated with lower forecast bias but is not significantly associated with forecast accuracy. VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion, as shown through language use.},

Examining the historical perspective offers a deeper understanding of how these approaches in science and philosophy have evolved over time, offering a more comprehensive embedding into the design process and its role within it.

  abstract = {The visualization and analysis of large graphs plays an essential role in various application fields. Since the size of graphs grew exponentially in the past few years, it became a challenge to reduce the visual clutter of dense and occluded graphs. By abstracting the structure of a node-link diagram, containing thousands of nodes and edges, visual clutter is reduced drastically, supporting the analysis of underlying patterns in an interactive approach. Additional visual techniques are used to overcome the challenge of representing the evolution of structural diagram changes and relationships between entities in dynamic graph visualization. The recent publications of large static and dynamic graph visualization techniques are using rich clients based on fast processing GPU algorithms, as well as distributed approaches for cluster-computing frameworks. Even though these techniques are capable of processing large-scale graphs interactively, they are also restricted by the user’s hardware or are more complex and expensive than simple client-server solutions. This thesis aims to provide an alternative approach, at providing a distributed, cross-platform, server-client application, able to visualize large node-link graphs, consisting of thousands of elements, interactively in a standard web-browser. We describe an aggregation strategy based on meta-elements, that provides an adjustable level of detail interface and visualizes the hierarchy of cumulative elements throughout multiple abstraction layers. By highlighting structural changes over time in dynamic graphs in combination with tools, such as panning and zooming and overview and detail, our system allows for dynamic graph exploration. We will demonstrate the usability of our technique by providing a complete prototype and present benchmarks on different graphs. Furthermore, we evaluate technical aspects of our approach as well as its applicability to large real-world graphs.},

Using scientific texts to map the lexical dimension, the premise posits that research communities can be visually represented by their members and the words they employ, favouring the comprehension of social structures. The research draws from a decade-long personal experimentation with language-based visual models, to explore how research communities appear according to their lexicon, in which each individual is intricately intertwined. Employing cutting-edge techniques of text analysis and network visualization, the study analyses, organizes and maps scientific communities, clustering individuals into thematic groups based on their language use. The findings are presented through a series of projects that delve into the analytical power of images and unveil novel visual methods to better understand the spatial dynamics of language and communities.},

However, little is known about how basic tabular data visualizations perform across varying data analysis tasks. In this paper, we report results from a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of five small scale (5-34 data points) two-dimensional visualization types—Table, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatterplot, and Pie Chart—across ten common data analysis tasks using two datasets. We find the effectiveness of these visualization types significantly varies across task, suggesting that visualization design would benefit from considering context-dependent effectiveness. Based on our findings, we derive recommendations on which visualizations to choose based on different tasks. We finally train a decision tree on the data we collected to drive a recommender, showcasing how to effectively engineer experimental user data into practical visualization systems.},

  abstract = {An essential purpose of choropleth maps is the visual perception of spatial patterns (such as the detection of hot spots or extreme values). This requires an effective and as intuitive as possible comparison of color values between different regions. Accordingly, a number of design requirements must be considered. Due to the lack of empirical evidence regarding some elementary design aspects, an online study with 260 participants was conducted. Three closely related effects were examined: the “dark-is-more bias” (i.e., the intuitive ranking of color lightness), the “area-size bias” (i.e., the neglect of small areas, since these are less dominant in perception than larger ones) and the “data-classification effect” (i.e., attention to data classification when interpreting spatial patterns). For each hypothesis, one or more maps in connection with single or multiple choice questions were presented. Users should detect extreme values, central tendencies or homogeneities of values as well as comment on their task solving certainty. In general, the hypotheses regarding the mentioned effects could be confirmed by statistical analysis. The results are used to derive conclusions and topics for future research. In particular, further comparative empirical studies are recommended to determine the best possible map types for given applications, also considering alternatives to choropleth maps.},

This opens up the field for novel cross-reality applications that distribute data analytics tasks along this continuum to combine benefits of established 2D information visualisation in the real environment with immersive analytics. In this publication, we explore this potential by transforming 2D graph data from a planar, large-scale display in the real environment into a spherical layout in augmented reality 3D space, letting it appear as if the graph is moving out of the display. We focus on design aspects of this transformation that potentially help users to form a joint mental model of both visualisations and to continue their tasks seamlessly in augmented reality. For this purpose, we implemented a framework of transformation parameters that can be categorised as follows: transformation methods, node transformation order (groupings) and different ways of visual interconnection. Variants in each of these areas were investigated in three quantitative user studies in which users had to solve a simple cluster search task. We confirmed that a visual transformation from 2D to 3D helps users to continue their tasks in augmented reality with less interruptions, and that node transformation order should be adjusted to data and task context. We further identified that users can perform tasks more efficiently when a user-controlled transformation is used, while a constant transformation with fixed duration can contribute to lower error rates.},

  abstract = {Indoor occupancy detection (IOD) via Wi-Fi sensing capitalizes on the varying patterns in CSI (Channel State Information) to estimate the number of people in a given area. However, the precision of such systems heavily depends on the quality of the CSI data, which can be degraded by noise and environmental factors. To address this issue, In this paper, we present a CSI preprocessing method to improve the accuracy of IOD systems using Wi-Fi sensing. Unlike existing preprocessing methods that use computationally complex signal processing or statistical techniques, we expand the dimension of CSI amplitude data into a three-channel vector through nonlinear transformation to amplify subtle differences between CSI data belonging to a different number of people. By drawing clearer boundaries between CSI data distributions belonging to a different number of people in a monitored area, our method improves the people-counting accuracy of a Wi-Fi sensing system. To ensure temporal consistency and improve data quality, we discretize the CSI measurements based on their transmission periods and aggregate consecutive measurements over a given time interval. These samples are then fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically trained for the IOD task. Experimental results in diverse real-world scenarios verify that compared to the traditional methods, the enhanced feature representation capability of our approach leads to more accurate and robust sensing outcomes even in the most resource-constrained environment, where a commercial off-the-shelf CSI capture machine with only one antenna is used when a Wi-Fi sender with one transmit antenna sends packets periodically to the channel with the smallest Wi-Fi channel bandwidth.},

  abstract = {Accessibility guidelines place restrictions on the use of animations and interactivity on webpages to lessen the likelihood of webpages inadvertently producing sequences with flashes, patterns, or color changes that may trigger seizures for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy. Online data visualizations often incorporate elements of animation and interactivity to create a narrative, engage users, or encourage exploration. These design guidelines have been empirically validated by perceptual studies in visualization literature, but the impact of animation and interaction in visualizations on users with photosensitivity, who may experience seizures in response to certain visual stimuli, has not been considered. We systematically gathered and tested 1,132 interactive and animated visualizations for seizure-inducing risk using established methods and found that currently available methods for determining photosensitive risk are not reliable when evaluating interactive visualizations, as risk scores varied significantly based on the individual interacting with the visualization. To address this issue, we introduce a theoretical model defining the degree of control visualization designers have over three determinants of photosensitive risk in potentially seizure-inducing sequences: the size, frequency, and color of flashing content. Using an analysis of 375 visualizations hosted on bl.ocks.org, we created a theoretical model of photosensitive risk in visualizations by arranging the photosensitive risk determinants according to the degree of control visualization authors have over whether content exceeds photosensitive accessibility thresholds. We then use this model to propose a new method of testing for photosensitive risk that focuses on elements of visualizations that are subject to greater authorial control – and are therefore more robust to variations in the individual user – producing more reliable risk assessments than existing methods when applied to interactive visualizations.

  abstract = {While visualizations are an effective way to represent insights about information, they rarely stand alone. When designing a visualization, text is often added to provide additional context and guidance for the reader. However, there is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the right amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties should be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in personal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper, we explore several research questions about the relative value of textual components of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts containing varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes) to a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what information they could take away from line charts containing text with varying semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded components. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. We compile these results into four chart design guidelines and discuss future implications for the combination of text and charts.},

We outlined the neurological traits of ADHD and discussed specifc fndings on accessible data visualizations for people with ADHD.

  abstract = {Bipartite networks are pervasive in modeling real-world phenomena and play a fundamental role in graph theory. Interactive exploratory visualization of such networks is an important problem, and particularly challenging when handling large networks. In this paper we present results from an investigation on using a general multilevel method for this purpose. Multilevel methods on networks have been introduced as a general approach to increase scalability of community detection and other complex optimization algorithms. They employ graph coarsening algorithms to create a hierarchy of increasingly coarser (reduced) approximations of an original network. Multilevel coarsening has been applied, e.g., to the problem of drawing simple (“unipartite”) networks. We build on previous work that extended multilevel coarsening to bipartite graphs to propose a visualization interface that uses multilevel coarsening to compute a multi-resolution hierarchical representation of an input bipartite network. From this hierarchy, interactive node-link drawings are displayed following a genuine route of the “overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand” visual information seeking mantra. Analysts may depart from the coarsest representation and select nodes or sub-graphs to be expanded and shown at greater detail. Besides intuitive navigation of large-scale networks, this solution affords great flexibility, as users are free to select different coarsening strategies in different scenarios. We illustrate its potential with case studies involving real networks on distinct domains. The experimental analysis shows our strategy is effective to reveal topological structures, such as communities and holes, that may remain hidden in a conventional node-link layout. It is also useful to highlight connectivity patterns across the bipartite layers, as illustrated in an example that emphasizes the correlation between diseases and genes in genetic disorders, and in a study of a scientific collaboration network of authors and papers.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            This paper introduces an automatic color design method that is driven by an importance function of the objects within a volumetric dataset. Our method allows the user to intuitively modify the object classification and the importance distribution function in the 2D rendered image. It automatically computes the transfer function, especially the color distribution, to convey the importance of the objects. In our approach, the importance of an object is represented as the attentiveness of a color. In addition, we preserve the color harmony in the rendered image in order to provide a visually pleasing result. In this paper, we propose a set of computational measurements to compute the color attentiveness and color harmony. Our color assignment algorithm supports arbitrary‐dimensional transfer functions and obtains interactive frame rates. Our method involves three color spaces, namely Coloroid system, CIE LCh               uv               , and Adobe RGB color space. It calculates the color attentiveness in CIE LCh               uv               space, and the color harmony in Coloroid system. It, then, assigns the transfer function in a dual space of Adobe RGB space and renders the resulting image in Adobe RGB space. We conducted a detailed user study, which proves that our method successfully conveys the importance distributions. Our contribution in this paper is not only our importance driven approach, but also our computational measurements and our color assignment algorithm.},

  abstract = {seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It provides a high-level interface to matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Functions in the seaborn library expose a declarative, dataset-oriented API that makes it easy to translate questions about data into graphics that can answer them. When given a dataset and a specification of the plot to make, seaborn automatically maps the data values to visual attributes such as color, size, or style, internally computes statistical transformations, and decorates the plot with informative axis labels and a legend. Many seaborn functions can generate figures with multiple panels that elicit comparisons between conditional subsets of data or across different pairings of variables in a dataset. seaborn is designed to be useful throughout the lifecycle of a scientific project. By producing complete graphics from a single function call with minimal arguments, seaborn facilitates rapid prototyping and exploratory data analysis. And by offering extensive options for customization, along with exposing the underlying matplotlib objects, it can be used to create polished, publication-quality figures.},

  abstract = {In this study, we propose a visualization technique to explore and visualize concept hierarchies generated from a textbook in the legal domain. Through a human-centered design process, we developed a tool that allows users to effectively navigate through and explore complex hierarchical concepts in three kinds of traversal techniques: top-down, middle-out, and bottom-up. Our concept hierarchies offer an overview over a given domain, with increasing level of detail toward the bottom of the hierarchy which is consisting of entities. In the legal use case we considered, the concepts were adapted from section headings in a legal textbook, whereas references to law or legal cases inside the textbook became entities. The design of this tool is refined following various steps such as gathering user needs, pain points of an existing visualization, prototyping, testing, and refining. The resulting interface offers users several key features such as dynamic search and filter, explorable concept nodes, and a preview of leaf nodes at every stage. A high-fidelity prototype was created to test our theory and design. To test our concept, we used the System Usability Scale as a way to measure the prototype's usability, a task-based survey to asses the tool's ability in assisting users in gathering information and interacting with the prototype, and finally mouse tracking to understand user interaction patterns. Along with this, we gathered audio and video footage of users when participating in the study. This footage also helped us in getting feedback when the survey responses required further information. The data collected provided valuable insights to set the directions for extending this study. As a result, we have accounted for varying hierarchy depths, longer text spans than only one to two words in the elements of the hierarchy, searchability, and exploration of the hierarchies. At the same time, we aimed for minimizing visual clutter and cognitive overload. We show that existing approaches are not suitable to visualize the type of data which we support with our visualization.},

Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data.  Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as  many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may  suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics.

The bar graph was first invented in 1786 and little has changed in its format. Here, a replacement for the bar graph is proposed. The new format, called a hat graph, maintains some of the critical features of the bar graph such as its discrete elements, but eliminates redundancies that are problematic when the baseline is not at zero. Hat graphs also include design elements based on Gestalt principles of grouping and graph design principles. The effectiveness of the hat graph was tested in five empirical studies. Participants were nearly 40\% faster to find and identify the condition that led to the biggest difference from baseline to final test when the data were plotted with hat graphs than with bar graphs. Participants were also more sensitive to the magnitude of an effect plotted with a hat graph compared with a bar graph that was restricted to having its baseline at zero. The recommendation is to use hat graphs when plotting data from discrete categories.},

Conventional data visualization tools and guidelines often do not actively consider the specific needs and abilities of people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), leaving them excluded from data-driven activities and vulnerable to ethical issues. To understand the needs and challenges people with IDD have with data, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with individuals with IDD and their caregivers. Our algorithmic interview approach situated data in the lived experiences of people with IDD to uncover otherwise hidden data encounters in their everyday life. Drawing on findings and observations, we characterize how they conceptualize data, when and where they use data, and what barriers exist when they interact with data. We use our results as a lens to reimagine the role of visualization in data accessibility and establish a critical near-term research agenda for cognitively accessible visualization.},

This adaptability has established them as the dominant force in building artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As visualization techniques intersect with these models, a new research paradigm emerges. This paper divides these intersections into two main areas: visualizations for foundation models (VIS4FM) and foundation models for visualizations (FM4VIS). In VIS4FM, we explore the primary role of visualizations in understanding, refining, and evaluating these intricate models. This addresses the pressing need for transparency, explainability, fairness, and robustness. Conversely, within FM4VIS, we highlight how foundation models can be utilized to advance the visualization field itself. The confluence of foundation models and visualizations holds great promise, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. By highlighting these challenges and the growing opportunities, this paper seeks to provide a starting point for continued exploration in this promising avenue.},

In a multimodal VE that incorporates a number of senses, i.e., visual, auditory, and touch or haptic, data is tangible along with its visual presentation. Variables are represented as haptic glyphs of different shapes, sizes, and other physical properties such as friction. Audio feedback helps further exploration of the data. The result of this pilot study demonstrates that glyphs can be successfully used for presenting multivariate data in a multimodal VE. This glyph-based multimodal presentation makes the information available to the blind and visually impaired (VI) in a semantic-aware environment. A multimodal VE also enriches the experience of the sighted users.},

State‐of‐the‐art tools allow users to interactively explore volumes with multiple linked parameter‐space views. However, interactions in the parameter space using trial‐and‐error may be unintuitive and time consuming. Furthermore, switching between different views may be distracting. In this paper, we propose GuideME: a novel slice‐guided semiautomatic multivariate volume exploration approach. Specifically, the approach comprises four stages: attribute inspection, guided uncertainty‐aware lasso creation, automated feature extraction and optional spatial fine tuning and visualization. Throughout the exploration process, the user does not need to interact with the parameter views at all and examples of complex real‐world data demonstrate the usefulness, efficiency and ease‐of‐use of our method.},

  abstract = {Colormaps are a vital method for users to gain insights into data in a visualization. With a good choice of colormaps, users are able to acquire information in the data more effectively and efficiently. In this survey, we attempt to provide readers with a comprehensive review of colormap generation techniques and provide readers a taxonomy which is helpful for finding appropriate techniques to use for their data and applications. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the basics of color spaces including color appearance models. In the core of our paper, we survey colormap generation techniques, including the latest advances in the field by grouping these techniques into four classes: procedural methods, user-study based methods, rule-based methods, and data-driven methods; we also include a section on methods that are beyond pure data comprehension purposes. We then classify colormapping techniques into a taxonomy for readers to quickly identify the appropriate techniques they might use. Furthermore, a representative set of visualization techniques that explicitly discuss the use of colormaps is reviewed and classified based on the nature of the data in these applications. Our paper is also intended to be a reference of colormap choices for readers when they are faced with similar data and/or tasks.},

  abstract = {People often take user ratings/reviews into consideration when shopping for products or services online. However, such user-generated data contains self-selection bias that could affect people's decisions and it is hard to resolve this issue completely by algorithms. In this work, we propose to raise people's awareness of the self-selection bias by making three types of information concerning user ratings/reviews transparent. We distill these three pieces of information, i.e., reviewers' experience, the extremity of emotion, and reported aspect(s), from the definition of self-selection bias and exploration of related literature. We further conduct an online survey to assess people's perceptions of the usefulness of such information and identify the exact facets (e.g., negative emotion) people care about in their decision process. Then, we propose a visual design to make such details behind user reviews transparent and integrate the design into an experimental website for evaluation. The results of a between-subjects study demonstrate that our bias-aware design significantly increases people's awareness of bias and their satisfaction with decision-making. We further offer a series of design implications for improving information transparency and awareness of bias in user-generated content.},
